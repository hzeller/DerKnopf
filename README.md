Remote controlled volume knob
=============================

A project to upgrade an amplifier without remote control to one with.

Replacing a regular potentiometer with a DS1882 and a rotational encoder.
Visual feedback with a charlie-plexed LED ring.

The interesting part is the infrared remote control: another rotational encoder,
with an infrared transmitter: a wireless extension of the volume knob.

(Work in progress; come here for pictures etc. later)
