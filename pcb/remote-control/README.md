Remote Control
==============

The remote control, operated with an Attiny44 on a CR2032 battery. Processor
gets woken up from power down state on state change of the inputs, so quiescent
current is less than 0.2 Î¼A.

With optional 1M pullups for the mechanical encoder, as these sometimes get
stuck in some half position, draining current through the pull-ups. The
standard pullups inside the attiny are aorund 60k (Note: this feature is not
used in the assembly below, just using the internal resistors.)

The shown programming header does not have a component associated on the board
as it was too bulky.

Single-sided board for simple home-etching.
